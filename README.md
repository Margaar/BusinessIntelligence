# BusinessIntelligence
My personal collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that I use to speed up day-to-day analytical work.
Includes a variety of small utilities, experiments, and data exploration workflows that help me process, clean, transform, and analyze real datasets more efficiently.

Its not a single project, but more a growing set of tools I build for myself while working with different types of data - especially large tables, import/export statistics, HS codes, country- and company-level splits, and monthly or Incoterms-based breakdowns.

What’s inside: 
examples of processing and analyzing large datasets;
custom functions for data cleaning and column standardization;
BI-style analysis (Import/Export flows, HS codes, countries, senders/recipients, Incoterms);
summary tables and pivot reports;
small experiments with automation and reusable analytics patterns;
occasional visualizations and preparatory code for dashboards.

I update the repository step by step as I learn new techniques or build tools that make my workflow faster or cleaner :)
